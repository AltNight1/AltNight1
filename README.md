### Hey there! 

Hey, Im AltNight, but I would prefer if you just called me Knight. I am an amateur CSS/HTML developer, 
if you can really call me that. I've never taken any classes on it besides the one i'm finishing up this semester.

I've always liked cats and fettechini alfredo... and video games. I hope one day I can make a living off of Web design/Matenience.
Big dream I know.

Please be nice. I'm kinda made a little crazy in the head.
